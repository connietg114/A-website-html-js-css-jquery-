            <li><strong>How many calls can be answered concurrently?</strong></li>
            <p class="faqAns" >We will discuss your requirements as we plan. The typical industry standard is 80:30 i.e. 80% of your calls need to be answered in 30 seconds. Depending on your requirements we can change the ratio. At the end it all comes down to your decision as to how you want your customer serviced.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li><strong>How many outbound calls can I make at the same time?</strong></li>
            <p class="faqAns" >Depending on your requirements and size of work assigned to us, we will discuss what works best for your business. It is a balance that needs to be maintained to ensure cost effectiveness of the investment you are making. We generally recommend an occupancy rate of 80% for each agent to ensure best quality service. </p>

            <li><strong>What are your charges?</strong></li>
            <p class="faqAns" >We recognize the fact that not all business are similar and have their own requirements. As our services are tailor-made for your organization, we discuss the costs involved once we understand the job requirements and resources needed.</p>
            <br><br>

            <p class="faqAns" >Reports are discussed during our initial discussions.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li><strong>What is the line quality?</strong></li>
            <p class="faqAns" >We use VoIP based lines and the quality is excellent with little to no lag.  The technology has evolved multifold over last few years and are very reliable. It also brings in significant cost savings for your business.  However, based on your requirements we can also organize for fall over lines should it be critical for your business.</p>
            <br><br>

            <li><strong>I treasure my customer database, how do I make sure that my data is secure?</strong></li>
            <p class="faqAns" >Great question. This is a major issue in outsourcing. 
            No matter how many iron-clad non-disclosure agreements you try to have a vendor sign, 
            unless you can really trust who you’re working with – there really is no other way to protect your data. 
            Once you’ve got your data in the hands of a company you trust, there are other measures you can take to keep it secure. 
            Like, simply having your database stored on-site in your office and having a few of our designated agents draw from the database to make or handle calls. 
            There is also the option of transporting the data to our location, and having it stored on a secure, fire-walled server to prevent break ins or any chance of data theft. 
            If you have highly sensitive data, like credit cards and social security numbers, we can plan out your security needs accordingly 
            and have them addressed before you outsource.</p>
